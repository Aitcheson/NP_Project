For the approximation solution we are using a greedy approach. First, we will take the vertex with the highest degree 
and select this vertex. We will then send this possible solution to the np-verifier. If the verifier returns false, we
select the next highest degree. If two vertices have the same degree, then we will randomly choose one.
